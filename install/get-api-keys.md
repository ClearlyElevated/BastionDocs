### Rocket League API Key

 Required by \`rocketLeague\` command.

[Rocket League's API](https://api.rocketleague.com) is currently in closed beta. So, you can't request an API key yet. Therefore, you can't use this command yet. Only a selected few have access their API. And Bastion is one of them, so the public Bastion bot can make use of the `rocketLeague` command. As soon as they allow public access to their API, you can request an API key and use the `rocketLeague` command in your self hosted Bastion.

### Twitch API Key

 Required by \`streamers\` and \`twitch\` commands.

  Before you can install Bastion, you need to create a bot application on
  Discord and invite your bot to your servers.

# Prerequisites

## Creating Discord Bot Application

Go to the [Discord Developer portal](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/). You will need to login with your Discord account, that you want your bot to be associated with, to create a Discord application.

After you've logged in, click on the **Create an application** button.

Here you can set some cool the name for your application, like Dark Lord or _Bastion!_ You can also set a neat avatar for your bot that will be displayed to everyone in Discord.

After you are done with customizing your Discord application, you will need to create a bot that will be associated with that application. To do that, go to the **Bot** section \(in the left sidebar\) and then click on the **Add Bot** button to give your application a visible life in Discord.

After your bot comes to life, you will find a few more options in there. Make sure to disable the **Public Bot** and **Requires OAuth2 Code Grant** options.

# Install on Windows

### Downloading the installer

[Right Click here](https://raw.github.com/TheBastionBot/BastionScripts/master/windows/chocolatey.ps1) and Click **Save Link Asâ€¦** and Save the file as `BastionInstaller.ps1` \(Bastion Installer for Windows\).

### Installing Bastion

First of all, open Windows PowerShell as Administrator. To do that, you can press the Start button, search for _PowerShell_ and when _Windows PowerShell_ appears in the search results, press Ctrl + Shift + Enter.

Now, type the following command in the PowerShell window:

```text
powershell
```

\(Note that there is a space after `powershell`\)

Then drag the `BastionInstaller.ps1` file you just download into the PowerShell window and press Enter.

Wait for a few moments, so that it can download and install everything you will need to run Bastion smoothly. Meanwhile, you can go grab a cup of coffee \(or tea, if you prefer that\).

Once it is done, it will let you know. This will install Bastion into your User directory: `C:\Users\<User Name>\`

Now, you will have a directory named `Bastion`, in your User directory, where Bastion is installed.

```

* **Make your Glitch project private before doing anything else so that your credentials are safe from others. If youâ€™re not able to do this, ask around in** [**Bastion HQ**](https://discord.gg/fzx8fkt) **and some amazing people will help you out**.
* Bastion will now be imported to Glitch in a few seconds.
* Now you can follow the configurations guide \(see the sidebar\) to configure Bastion and you're good to go. Once you configure it correctly, it'll automatically start.

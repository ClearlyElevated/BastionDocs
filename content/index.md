Welcome to The Bastion Bot Documentation Site.

Here you'll find documentation on how to install, set up, run and update
Bastion, so that you can empower your Discord server and have an awesome bot
for your communities.

All of our [documentation is on GitHub](https://github.com/TheBastionBot/BastionDocs)
and we would ❤ corrections and improvements!

Come hang out in [Bastion HQ](https://discord.gg/fzx8fkt) if you wanna chat with
other users, as well as the devs, and see what’s being cranked out.

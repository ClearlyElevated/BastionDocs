{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Bastion stores some configurations and credentials in its <code>settings</code> directory.\nIt refers to it before booting up and if you have not set it up yet or made some\nmistakes, Bastion will not be able to start. So, this is a very important step.</p>\n<p>There are two important files that needs to be inside the <code>settings</code> directory:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>config.json</code></li>\n<li><code>credentials.json</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Make sure those files are present before you start Bastion. If they are not\npresent in there, don't worry, you will find two other files named\n<code>config_example.json</code> and <code>credentials_example.json</code>. Make a copy of both these\nfiles and remove the <code>_example</code> part from the copies. Now, you should have these\nfiles inside the <code>settings</code> directory:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>config.json</code></li>\n<li><code>config_example.json</code></li>\n<li><code>credentials.json</code></li>\n<li><code>credentials_example.json</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now, open and edit the <code>config.json</code> and <code>credentials.json</code> files to add (or\nedit) the configurations and credentials of Bastion, respectively. And after you\ndo that, save the files.</p>\n<h4>Additional steps</h4>\n<p><em>This step is only necessary if you are hosting Bastion on Heroku.</em></p>\n<p>Now you need to copy these files to Heroku (and whenever you make any changes to\nthem). Run the following commands to push these files to Heroku:  </p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">git add -f settings/config.json settings/credentials.json\ngit commit -m \"Initial Bastion Configuration\"\ngit push heroku master\n</code></pre>","frontmatter":{"title":"Configure Bastion","description":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/configure/"}}
